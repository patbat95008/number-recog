This is a "simple" deep learning AI model, using the Keras API.
It is built to recognize the MSINT handwritten digits sample.

Requires Tensorflow and Keras packages.

First, train the model using:
python3 ./number-recog-trainer-1.py

Then, show off the model by running:
python3 ./number-recog-runner.py
